I built this after reading a guide on how to build React from scratch by @pomber

This obviosuly isn't the entire React library but it does have the core functionality of React and the useState hook.

I did this so that I could gain a deeper understanding of React. I will be adding to this in the future at some point, It still needs a lot of optimizations and more hooks.
